## Details
Data is generated by taking the average Mean and Histograms of price movements for each day over a
reference ‘window’ using the 15 years of the ASX 300.

Each day of the dataset was categorised in their relevant window, and price and
frequencies calculated.
The values for the daily histogram for each reference window can than be charted, with price spread
on the Y axis, and day of the year on the X, and frequency of price point represented by the intensity
of the colour. As below:

The trends are then combined into a single image. Frequencies are intensified die to constructive interference.
